# Quiz 2

__Points Possible:__ 100

__Date:__ Thursday, October 10th 


## Background 
This quiz is based on the topics covered in weeks 4 through 6. There are 3 sections â€” short answer questions, tracing, and a programming problem. Students are allowed to use the Thonny IDE for __Section III only__. Please see the grading rubric for the programming problem. Scratch paper and a simple calculator are allowed.

## Submission
* Submit a `quiz2.txt` file on Blackboard with your answers.
* Submit any Python code from the Thonny IDE on Blackboard.


## Section I (20 points)

    print(i)
    i = i + 2
```
* **A.** 20
* **B.** 22
* **C.** 21
* **D.** 40


**2.** What sequence is generated by `range(2, 20, 2)`
* **A.**	2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20
* **B.**	2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18
* **C.**    2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18
* **D.**	4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18


**3.** What happens when you run this Python program?
```python
balance = compute_balance(100, 3000)    
print(balance)
 
def compute_balance(deposit, balance):
    return(deposit + balance)
```
* **A.** The program prints:  3100
* **B.** NameError: name 'compute_balance' is not defined
* **C.** NameError: name 'balance' is not defined
* **D.** NameError: name 'deposit' is not defined`


**4.** Convert the following `for` loop statement to a `while` loop:
```python
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 20):
    sum = sum + i
    print(sum)
```


**5.** Assume, `age = 24`, `height = 6` 
    
```python
not (age > 18 or height == 6)
```

What is the value of the expression?

* **A.** True
* **B.** False


**6.** Find the error in the following Python code:

```python
Line 1: def function1(y):
Line 2:     if x > y:
Line 3:         print("x is greater")
Line 4:
Line 5: function1(2)
```
* Which **line number** has an error. 
* **Explain** in one sentence, what is the error.



**7.** What will be the output of the following?
```python
sum_val = 0

for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    sum_val += i

print(sum_val)
```

* **A.** 	120
* **B.** 	25
* **C.** 	20
* **D.** 	None of the above


**8.** What sequence is generated by `range(24, 4, -4)`
* **A.**	4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24
* **B.**	24,20,16,12,8,4
* **C.**    24,20,16,12,8
* **D.**	4,8,12,16,20,24


**9.** Consider the following Python program.
```python
def find_min(num1, num2, num3):
    min_val = min(num1, num2, num3)
    return min_val

print(find_min(2, 3, 5))
```

What will be the output?
* **A.** 2
* **B.** 3
* **C.** 5
* **D.** Error


**10.** Assume `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 3`, `d = 4`, `e = 5`:
```python
( (a > c) or ( (c + 1 < e) and (c - b > a) ) )
```

What is the value of the expression?

* **A.** True
* **B.** False



## Section II (30 points)

Trace the execution of the following program by filling in a tracing table. You can draw the tracing table on a piece of paper and include an image file (`tracing.png`) on Blackboard. 

You may use the following guide for reference: 
* [Tracing Worksheet](/guides/tracing)


```python
result = 1
for n in range(4):
    result = result * n
print(result)
```


## Section III (50 points)

Programming question:
* You can use the Thonny Python IDE for writing the program.


<br />
Write a module that contains the following two functions:

```python
# Converts from feet to meters
# Returns the result in meters
def foot_to_meter(foot):

# Converts from meters to feet
# Returns the result in feet
def meter_to_foot(meter):
```

The formulas for the conversion are:

$$
foot = \frac{meter}{0.3048}
$$
$$
meter = 0.3048 \times foot
$$

Test your functions by writing code that invokes these functions to display the following tables:

```
Feet Meters
1 0.3048
2 0.6096
3 0.9144000000000001
4 1.2192
5 1.524
6 1.8288000000000002
7 2.1336
8 2.4384
9 2.7432000000000003
10 3.048

Meters Feet
20 65.61679790026247
21 68.89763779527559
22 72.17847769028872
23 75.45931758530183
24 78.74015748031496
25 82.02099737532808
26 85.30183727034121
27 88.58267716535433
28 91.86351706036744
29 95.14435695538057
30 98.42519685039369
```


In the code used to test your functions:
* Use a loop and call the `foot_to_meter(foot)` function to print the table. Input statements are not required as the loop runs from `1` to `10` (see the sample table)
* Use a loop and call `meter_to_foot(meter)` function to print the table. Input statements are not required as the loop runs from `20` to `30` (see the sample table)
* Save your program as `length.py` and attach it to Blackboard.
