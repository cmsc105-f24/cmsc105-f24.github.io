# Quiz 2 review 

## Background 
The quiz will be based on the topics covered in weeks 4 through 6. There are 3 sections â€” short answer questions, tracing, and a programming problem. Students are allowed to use the Thonny IDE for __Section III only__. Please see the grading rubric for the programming problem. Scratch paper and a simple calculator are allowed.


## Section I (20 points)

			
**1.** How many times does the following loop iterate?			
```python
i = 0
while i <= 45:
    print(i)
    i = i + 5
```

**2.** What sequence is generated by `range(3, 33, 3)`


**3.** What happens when you run this Python program?
```python
tip = compute_tip_amount(100, 15)    
print(tip)
 
def compute_tip_amount(bill_amount, tip_percentage):
    return(bill_amount * (tip_percentage / 100))
```
* **A.** The program prints:  15.0
* **B.** NameError: name 'compute_tip_amount' is not defined
* **C.** NameError: name 'tip' is not defined
* **D.** NameError: name 'bill_amount' is not defined`


**4.** Convert the following `for` loop statement to a `while` loop:
```python
sum = 0
for i in range(100, 0, -2):
    sum = sum + i
    print(sum)
```


**5.** Assume, `age = 24`, `height = 6` 
    
```python
not (age <= 18 or height != 6)
```

What is the value of the expression?

* **A.** True
* **B.** False


**6.** Find the error in the following Python code:

```python
Line 1: def function1(y):
Line 2:     result = x + y
Line 3:     print(result)
Line 4:
Line 5: function1(5)
```
* Which **line number** has an error. 
* **Explain** in one sentence, what is the error.



**7.** What will be the output of the following?
```python
sum_val = 0

for i in range(4, 16, 3):
    sum_val += i

print(sum_val)
```



**8.** What will be the output of the following?
```python
num = 24

def print_number():
    num = 4
    print(num)

print_number()
print(num)
```



**9.** Consider the following Python program.
```python
def find_max(num1, num2, num3):
    max_val = max(num1, num2, num3)
    return max_val

print(find_max(2, 3, 5))
```

What will be the output?



**10.** Assume `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 3`, `d = 4`, `e = 5`:
```python
( (a <= c) or ( (c + 2 == e) and (c - b > a) ) )
```

What is the value of the expression?

* **A.** True
* **B.** False



## Section II (30 points)

Trace the execution of the following program by filling in a tracing table. You can draw the tracing table on a piece of paper and include an image file (`tracing.png`) on Blackboard. 

You may use the following guide for reference: 
* [Tracing Worksheet](/guides/tracing)


```python
count = 3
result = 1
while count > 0:
    result = result * count
    count = count - 1
print(result)
```


## Section III (50 points)

Programming question:
* You can use the Thonny Python IDE for writing the program.


<br />
Write a module that contains the following two functions:

```python
# Converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit
# Returns the result in Fahrenheit
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):

# Converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius
# Returns the result in Celsius
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
```

The formulas for the conversion are:

$$
Fahrenheit = (Celsius \times 1.8) + 32
$$
$$
Celsius = \frac{Fahrenheit - 32}{1.8}
$$

Test your functions by writing code that invokes these functions to display the following tables:

```
   Celsius  |  Fahrenheit
--------------------------
         0  |        32.0
        10  |        50.0
        20  |        68.0
        30  |        86.0
        40  |       104.0
        50  |       122.0
        60  |       140.0
        70  |       158.0
        80  |       176.0
        90  |       194.0
       100  |       212.0

Fahrenheit  |     Celsius
--------------------------
       -20  |       -28.9
       -10  |       -23.3
         0  |       -17.8
        10  |       -12.2
        20  |        -6.7
        30  |        -1.1
        40  |         4.4
        50  |        10.0
        60  |        15.6
```


In the code used to test your functions:
* Use a loop and call the `celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)` function to print the table. Input statements are not required as the loop runs from `0` to `100` (see the sample table)
* Use a loop and call `fahrenheit_to_celsius(meter)` function to print the table. Input statements are not required as the loop runs from `-20` to `60` (see the sample table)
