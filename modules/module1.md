# Module 1: Your First Program

* First read this page then start coding the module.
* Post your Python files to Blackboard under the module 1 assignment.


### Objectives

Experience writing a really simple program.  


## Hello World in Python 

Here is the classic Hello World program in Python:

__hello.py__
 ```Python
print("Hello World!")
 ```

This is a simple program written in the Python programming language, possibly one of the smallest programs one can write, and a traditional starting point for learning programming.


## Hello World Variation

We will now spend a bit of time trying a few variations, and also examining what happens when typing mistakes are made.

Consider this program:

__helloname.py__
```Python
print("Hello World!")
print("My name is X")
```

Type up this program but use your own name instead of X.

## What happens when things go (even slightly) wrong

We'll now deliberately make a few tiny errors and see what happens:

##### Error #1: forgetting to type the closing parenthesis.

__error1.py__
```Python
print("Hello World!"
```

Note the missing right parenthesis at the end of the line.
* What happens when we nonetheless try and run the program?


##### Error #2: What happens if we forget the quotation marks?

__error2.py__
```Python
print(Hello World!)
```

* What happens when we nonetheless try and run the program?
