---

## **Event Details**
- **Themes**: 
    - Automate Your World: Build Python scripts to automate small tasks (e.g., file organization, data cleaning, or reminders).
    - Game On: Create simple text-based games (e.g., trivia, number guessing, or basic RPGs).
    - Data Exploration: Use Python to analyze and visualize a dataset.
    - Everyday Tools: Build small utilities like to-do lists, or calculators.
- **Date**: December 16th
- **Time**: 2pm
- **Location**: Jepson Hall G03
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Team Size**: 3 students per team

---

## **Objectives**
- Reinforce Python concepts like loops, lists, dictionaries, strings, file I/O, and basic classes.
- Work collaboratively to design, develop, and present a project.
- Build confidence in your programming abilities while having fun!

## **Hackathon Structure**
### 1. **Kickoff (30 minutes)**
- Introduction to the theme and rules
- Team formation (if not already done)
- Brainstorming session
- Eat lunch

### 2. **Development (2 hours)**
- Teams work on their projects.
- Mentors are available to answer questions or help troubleshoot.

### 3. **Demonstrations (30 minutes)**
- Each team presents a 5-minute demo of their project.
- Teams explain their idea, approach, and code.

## **Project Guidelines**
1. **Scope**: Your project should be achievable within the time limit and align with the theme.
2. **Topics Covered**: Use concepts learned in class:
   - Loops, lists, dictionaries, strings, file I/O, and basic classes.
3. **Tools**:
   - Use Thonny Python IDE 
   - Optional libraries: `random`, `math`, `matplotlib`, ` etc.
4. **Teamwork**:
   - Assign roles (e.g., coder, tester) to collaborate effectively.
5. **Deliverables**:
   - A working project demo.
   - Brief explanation of your code and approach.
