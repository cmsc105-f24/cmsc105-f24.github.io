# Lab 9: More Lists


## Program 1: Concatenate Lists

**concatenate.py**

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will concatenate the two lists using the
list elements index-wise (i.e. create a new list and print it).
You may assume that both `list1` and `list2` are the same length.
'''

list1 = ['W','ar','learn','pyt']
list2 = ['e','e','ing','hon']

list3 = []

for i in range(len(list1)):
    list3.append(list1[i] + list2[i])
    
print(list3)
```


# Program 2: Find Minimum


**min.py**
```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will contain a function `findMin(list_of_numbers)`
that takes as input argument a list `list_of_numbers` and
returns the index of the minimum value in the list.
'''

# This function will return the index of the minimum value in the list.
def findMin(list_of_numbers):
    # Create a variable that will store the index of the minimum value
    # in the list, intialize it to 0 (first index).
    min_index = 0
    # Create a variable to store the current minimum value in the list,
    # initialize it to the first value in the list.
    min_value = list_of_numbers[0]
    
    # For each index in the range 0 up to the length of the list of numbers.
    for i in range(len(list_of_numbers)):
        # Check to see if the next item in the list is less than the stored minimum value.
        if list_of_numbers[i] < min_value:
            # It is less than, so update the minimum.
            min_value = list_of_numbers[i]
            # Also, update the min_index variable.
            min_index = i

    # Return the index of the minimum value in the list.
    return min_index
        
    
# Call the findMin function to test it.
print(findMin([2,4,3,0,1]))

```


## Program 3: Grades

**grades.py**

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will analyze a list of student grades.
The program will allow the user to input grades, and then it will
perform various operations such as finding the highest and lowest grades,
calculating the average, sorting the grades, and determining if a
specific grade exists in the list.
'''

# params: grades list
# returns: average grade
def calculate_average(grades):
    # Create a variable to hold the sum of the grades. 
    sum_of_grades = 0
    # For each grade in the grades list.
    for grade in grades:
        # Add the grade to the sum of the grades variable.
        sum_of_grades += grade
    # Return the average be dividing the sum of the grades by the length of the grades list.
    return sum_of_grades / len(grades)
# Also acceptable: return sum(grades) / len(grades)

# Function to find the maximum grade
# params: grades list
# returns: maximum grade
def find_max(grades):
    # Initialize a variable to store the maximum grade.
    max_grade = grades[0]
    # For each grade in the grades list.
    for grade in grades:
        # If the grade is less than the maximum grade found so far.
        if grade > max_grade:
            # Update the maximum grade.

# params: grades list
# returns: minimum grade

            # Update the minimum grade.
