# Lab 3: Pointers and References in C++

__Points Possible:__ 100

__Due:__ Thursday, September 12th 

In this lab, we will practice the concepts learned in week three. We will use math module functions, string functions, and Python programming to solve the problems.

Submission:
1.	Submit a Python file for each of the four programs.

### Pair programming

Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one computer. One, the **driver**, writes code while the other, the **navigator**, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. **The two programmers switch roles frequently.**

* This is a **group assignment**, but you should each **turn in your code individually**. 
* Groups will be assigned at the beginning of lab.
* **Rules for groups work:**
    * Do not divide and conquer, i.e., do not assign each person an exercise to work on individually.
    * **Work together** on **each** exercise and share responsibilities, each person should have a chance to write code.


## Program 1: Math and Strings


Write a program that prints the results of the following:

1.	$sin(2 \pi)$				(you can use `math.pi`)
2.	$log(16)$				(use natural log)
3.	`round(-12.5)`
4.	
   ```python
   string_val="Introduction to Computing."
   string_val[:-1]
   ```
5.	
   ```python
   string_val=" Introduction to Computing."
   string_val[2:]
   ```

Save the program is `math.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment. 


## Program 2: Compute Interest

Write a program that reads the values of total amount and interest rate. Then prints the value of the interest amount. Please display the result up to 2 decimal places.



Save the program is `interest.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.
