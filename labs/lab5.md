# Lab 5: Loops 

__Points Possible:__ 100

__Due:__ Thursday, October 3rd

In this lab, we will write programs using loops.

Submission:
1.	Submit a Python file for each of the programs.

### Pair programming

Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one computer. One, the **driver**, writes code while the other, the **navigator**, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. **The two programmers switch roles frequently.**

* This is a **group assignment**, but you should each **turn in your code individually**. 
* Groups will be assigned at the beginning of lab.
* **Rules for groups work:**
    * Do not divide and conquer, i.e., do not assign each person an exercise to work on individually.
    * **Work together** on **each** exercise and share responsibilities, each person should have a chance to write code.

## Program 1: `while` loop

Using `while` loop, write a program to `print` the first 50 even numbers starting from 2.

Save the program is `loop.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment. 

**Grading Rubric for the program:**
(Comments: 5 points, input:10, computation:10, output:5)
**Total: 30 points**


## Program 2: Names

Using a loop (`for` or `while`), write a program that reads 10 different names from a user. If the name contains the letter 'e', continue with next iteration. If it doesn't contain the alphabet 'e', `print` the message "Name Accepted" and stop.								

**Hint:** Use `find` function to search for a letter in the string.

Save the program is `names.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment. 

**Grading Rubric for the program:**
(Comments: 5 points, input:10, computation:10, output:5)
**Total: 40 points**


## Program 3: `for` loop

Using `for` loops, write a program to `print` the numbers in reverse order from 100 to 1.

**Hint:** `for i in range(100, 0, -1)` can be helpful.				

Save the program is `countdown.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment. 

**Grading Rubric for the program:**
(Comments: 5 points, input:10, computation:10, output:5)
**Total: 30 points**
