# Lab 6: Functions

__Points Possible:__ 100

__Due:__ Thursday, October 10th

In this lab, we will write programs using functions.

Submission:
1.	Submit a Python file for each of the programs.

## Program 1: Calculate Discount

Write a function `calculate_discount` that takes as input 2 parameters: price, discount rate (in %), and return the discount. 

Write a test program to read the price and discount rate values (using input statements outside the function) and display the discount by calling the `calculate_discount` function (invoke function) and printing the return value of the discount.

Save the program is `discount.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.


## Program 2: Divide By

Write 3 functions with the requirement as mentioned below:
* Write a function `divBy5(num)` that takes as input a number and returns `True` if the number is divisible by 5. It returns `False` otherwise.
* Write a function `divBy6(num)` that takes as input a number and returns `True` if the number is divisible by 6. It returns `False` otherwise.
* Write another function `divBy5and6(num)` that takes as input a number num and calls `divBy5(num)` and `divBy6(num)`. The function returns `True` if the output/returned values from both `divBy5(num)` and `divBy6(num)` are `True`. It returns `False` otherwise.

Write a test program to read a number from the user (using an input statement outside the functions) and call the `divBy5and6(num)` function (invoke function) and printing the return value from the function.

Save the program is `divideby.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.



## Grading Rubric for each of the functions:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Grading</td>
        <td>Points Possible</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Appropriate docstring and comments</td>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Input and output</td>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Computation</td>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Function invocation</td>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
</table>

**TOTAL	25 points for each function**
