# Lab 11: File I/O

## Program 1: Word Counter

**word_counter.py**
```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will count the words in a text file.
'''

# Open the file for reading.
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    # Initialize a word counter.
    word_count = 0
    
    # For each line in a file.
    for line in file:
        # Increment the word count by the length of the line
        # after it is split into a words list by spaces.
        word_count += len(line.split())
    
    # Print out the word count.
    print(word_count)
```

OR:

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will count the words in a text file.
'''

print(len(open("sample.txt", "r").read().split()))
```



## Program 2: Uppercase Writer

**uppercase_writer.py***

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will open a file and
write the contents as all upper case letters.
'''

# A list of lines to write
lines_to_write = []

# With the file to read open. Using read mode.
with open("textfile.txt", "r") as file_to_read:
    # For each line in the file.
    for line in file_to_read:
        # Append the upper case version of the line to the lines_to_write list.
        lines_to_write.append(line.upper())

# With te file to write open. Using write mode.
with open("uppercase_output.txt", "w") as file_to_write:
    # Write the lines_to_write list to the file.
    file_to_write.writelines(lines_to_write)
```

OR:

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will open a file and
write the contents as all upper case letters.
'''

# With the file to read open. Using read mode.
with open("textfile.txt", "r") as file_to_read:
    # Read the text into a file.
    text = file_to_read.read()

# With te file to write open. Using write mode.
with open("uppercase_output.txt", "w") as file_to_write:
    # Write the text uppercase to a file.
    file_to_write.write(text.upper())
```



## Program 3: Grade Average Calculator

**grade_calculator.py**

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will read a list of grades from a file,
calculates the average grade, and appends the average
to the end of the file.
'''

# With the file grades.txt open in read/write mode.
with open("grades.txt", "r+") as grades_file:
    # Create a new grades list.
    grades = []
    
    # For each line in the grades file.
    for line in grades_file:
        print(line)
        # Add the grade to the grades list after converting to a number.
        grades.append(eval(line))
    
    # Compute the average.
    average = sum(grades) / len(grades)
    
    # Now append the average to the file.
    grades_file.write("\nAverage: " + str(average))
```


## Program 4: Student Grades Report

**student_grades_report.py**
```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will read student grades from a file,
processes each studentâ€™s grades, and writes a report
with the highest, lowest, and average grades for each
student to a new file.
'''

# Open the student grades file.
# The file is of the format: StudentName, Grade1, Grade2, Grade3
with open("student_grades.txt", "r") as grades_file:
    with open("grades_report.txt", "w") as grades_report: 
        # For each line in the student grades file.
        for line in grades_file:
            # Split the line into a list. This split will occur at the commas.
            grade_file_line_as_list = line.split(",")
            
            # Get the student, which is the first item in the list (index 0).
            student = grade_file_line_as_list[0]
            
            # Get the grades which are the remaining items.
            # Use a list splice to get from index 1 until the end.
            grades_as_strings = grade_file_line_as_list[1:]
            
            # Create a new empty list to store the grades after we convert them to integers.
            grades_as_integers = []
            
            # Convert the grades as strings list to grades as integers list.
            # For each grade in the grades as strings list.
            for grade in grades_as_strings:
                # Evaluate the grade to convert it to a number.
                grades_as_integers.append(eval(grade))
            
            # The output format is: StudentName - Highest: 90, Lowest: 79, Average: 85.67
            # Build the report string, end it with a new line character \n.
            report = student \
                + " - Highest: " + str(max(grades_as_integers)) \
                + ", Lowest: " + str(min(grades_as_integers)) \
                + ", Average: " + str(sum(grades_as_integers) / len(grades_as_integers)) + "\n" 
            
            # Write this report string to the grades report file.
            grades_report.write(report)
```
