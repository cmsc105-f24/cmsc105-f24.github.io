# Lab 11: File I/O

__Points Possible:__ 100

__Due:__ Thursday, November 14th

In this lab, we will write programs using Python file input and output commands.

Use the [File I/O guide](/guides/file) for assistance. 

Submission:
1.	Submit a Python file for each of the programs.


## Program 1: Word Counter

Write a program `word_counter.py` that reads from a text file, counts the number of words in the file, and outputs the count to the console.  

- Save the file called [sample.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmsc105-f24/code/refs/heads/main/sample.txt)
- Your program should read the contents of `sample.txt` and count the words.
- For simplicity, you can define a word as any sequence of characters separated by whitespace.

**Sample Output:**
```
Word count: 46
```

Save the program as `word_counter.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

**Grading Rubric for the program:**  
(Headers and comments: 5 points, file reading: 5 points, word count calculation: 10 points, output: 5 points)  
**Total: 25 points**  


**word_counter.py**
```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will count the words in a text file.
'''

# Open the file for reading.
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    # Initialize a word counter.
    word_count = 0
    
    # For each line in a file.
    for line in file:
        # Increment the word count by the length of the line
        # after it is split into a words list by spaces.
        word_count += len(line.split())
    
    # Print out the word count.
    print(word_count)
```

OR:

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will count the words in a text file.
'''

print(len(open("sample.txt", "r").read().split()))
```



## Program 2: Uppercase Writer

Write a program `uppercase_writer.py` that reads from one file, converts its content to uppercase, and writes the uppercase text to a new file.  

- Create a file named `textfile.txt` with sample lowercase text.
- Read the contents of `textfile.txt` and write the uppercase version of the content to a new file named `uppercase_output.txt`.
- After running the program, `uppercase_output.txt` should contain the uppercase text from `textfile.txt`.

**Sample Input (textfile.txt):**  
```
hello world  
this is a test file  
```

**Sample Output (uppercase_output.txt):**  
```
HELLO WORLD  
THIS IS A TEST FILE  
```

Save the program as `uppercase_writer.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

**Grading Rubric for the program:**  
(Headers and comments: 5 points, file reading: 5 points, text transformation: 10 points, file writing: 5 points)  
**Total: 25 points**  


**uppercase_writer.py***

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will open a file and
write the contents as all upper case letters.
'''

# A list of lines to write
lines_to_write = []

# With the file to read open. Using read mode.
with open("textfile.txt", "r") as file_to_read:
    # For each line in the file.
    for line in file_to_read:
        # Append the upper case version of the line to the lines_to_write list.
        lines_to_write.append(line.upper())

# With te file to write open. Using write mode.
with open("uppercase_output.txt", "w") as file_to_write:
    # Write the lines_to_write list to the file.
    file_to_write.writelines(lines_to_write)
```

OR:

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will open a file and
write the contents as all upper case letters.
'''

# With the file to read open. Using read mode.
with open("textfile.txt", "r") as file_to_read:
    # Read the text into a file.
    text = file_to_read.read()

# With te file to write open. Using write mode.
with open("uppercase_output.txt", "w") as file_to_write:
    # Write the text uppercase to a file.
    file_to_write.write(text.upper())
```



## Program 3: Grade Average Calculator

Write a program `grade_calculator.py` that reads a list of grades from a file, calculates the average grade, and __appends__ the average to the end of the file.  

- Create a file called `grades.txt` with a list of integer grades, one per line.
- Read all the grades, compute the average, and append the average grade to the end of the file in the format:  
  ```
  Average: [calculated_average]
  ```
  
**Sample Input (grades.txt):**  
```
85  
90  
78  
92  
88  
```

**Sample Output (grades.txt after running the program):**  
```
85  
90  
78  
92  
88  
Average: 86.6
```

Save the program as `grade_calculator.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

**Grading Rubric for the program:**  
(Headers and comments: 5 points, file reading: 5 points, average calculation: 10 points, file writing/appending: 5 points)  
**Total: 25 points**  

**grade_calculator.py**

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will read a list of grades from a file,
calculates the average grade, and appends the average
to the end of the file.
'''

# With the file grades.txt open in read/write mode.
with open("grades.txt", "r+") as grades_file:
    # Create a new grades list.
    grades = []
    
    # For each line in the grades file.
    for line in grades_file:
        print(line)
        # Add the grade to the grades list after converting to a number.
        grades.append(eval(line))
    
    # Compute the average.
    average = sum(grades) / len(grades)
    
    # Now append the average to the file.
    grades_file.write("\nAverage: " + str(average))
```


## Program 4: Student Grades Report

Write a program `student_grades_report.py` that reads student grades from a file, processes each student’s grades, and writes a report with the highest, lowest, and average grades for each student to a new file.

- Create a file `student_grades.txt` with each line containing a student’s name followed by a list of grades, separated by commas, e.g.:  
  ```
  Alice,88,90,79  
  Bob,72,85,91  
  Charlie,100,95,100  
  ```
- Read each line from `student_grades.txt`, calculate the highest, lowest, and average grade for each student, and write these results to a new file `grades_report.txt` in the following format:  
  ```
  Alice - Highest: 90, Lowest: 79, Average: 85.67  
  Bob - Highest: 91, Lowest: 72, Average: 82.67  
  Charlie - Highest: 100, Lowest: 95, Average: 98.33  
  ```

Save the program as `student_grades_report.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

**Grading Rubric for the program:**  
(Headers and comments: 5 points, file reading: 5 points, data processing: 15 points, file writing: 5 points)  
**Total: 25 points** 


**student_grades_report.py**

        # For each line in the student grades file.
        for line in grades_file:
            # Split the line into a list. This split will occur at the commas.
            grade_file_line_as_list = line.split(",")
            
            # Get the student, which is the first item in the list (index 0).
            student = grade_file_line_as_list[0]
            
            # Get the grades which are the remaining items.
            # Use a list splice to get from index 1 until the end.
            grades_as_strings = grade_file_line_as_list[1:]
            
            # Create a new empty list to store the grades after we convert them to integers.
            grades_as_integers = []
            
            # Convert the grades as strings list to grades as integers list.
            # For each grade in the grades as strings list.
            for grade in grades_as_strings:
                # Evaluate the grade to convert it to a number.
                grades_as_integers.append(eval(grade))
            
            # The output format is: StudentName - Highest: 90, Lowest: 79, Average: 85.67

            report = student \
                + " - Highest: " + str(max(grades_as_integers)) \
                + ", Lowest: " + str(min(grades_as_integers)) \
                + ", Average: " + str(sum(grades_as_integers) / len(grades_as_integers)) + "\n"
