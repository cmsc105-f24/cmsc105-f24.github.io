# Lab 8: Lists

## Program 1: Color counter

**colors.py**
```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will count colors in a list of colors.
'''

# Function that takes as input a string of colors separated 
# by spaces called colorString` and a second input called colorToCount. 
# The function will count the colorToCount in the string of colors.
def countColor(colorString, colorToCount):
    # First split the string into a list.
    colorList = colorString.split()
    # Count the color
    count = colorList.count(colorToCount)
    # Return the count
    return count

# Input the colors list and the color to count.
colors = input("Enter colors: ")
color_to_count = input("Enter color to count: ")

print(color_to_count, "appears", countColor(colors, color_to_count), "times")
```

# Program 2: Find Names

**names.py**
```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will find the position of a name in a list of names.
'''

# Function takes as input a string of names separated by 
# spaces and a second input argument called nameToFind. 
# The function will return the first position of nameToFind in the string of 
# names and return -1 if nameToFind doesnâ€™t exist in the string of names.
def findName(namesString, nameToFind):
    # Split the names string into a list.
    namesList = namesString.split()
    # If the name is in the name list.
    if nameToFind in namesList:
        # The get the index of the first time the name is found.
        # We add one to this zero based (starts at zero) index to get 
        # the position in the list which is one based (starts at one). 
        return namesList.index(nameToFind) + 1
    else:
        return -1

# Input the names list and the name to find.
names = input("Enter names: ")
name_to_find = input("Enter a name to find: ")

position = findName(names, name_to_find)
if position > 0:
    print(name_to_find, "exists at the position number", position)
else:
    print(name_to_find, "not found in list")
```


## Program 3: Scores

**scores.py**

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
Reads an unspecified number of scores and determines how many 
scores are above or equal to the average and how many scores 
are below the average.
'''

# Finds the average of a list of scores.
def findAverage(scores_list):
    total = 0
    # For each score in the list of scores add it to the total.
    for score in scores_list:
        total += score
    # Return the average which is the total divided by the the length of the list.
    return total / len(scores_list)

# Function to find the number of scores that are above or equal to the average
def aboveAndEqualToAverageCount(scores_list, average):
    total = 0
    # For each score in the scores list compare to the average.
    for score in scores_list:
        # If the score is above or equal to the average increment the total.
        if score >= average:
            total += 1
    return total   

# Function to find the number of scores that are below average
def belowAverageCount(scores_list, average):
    total = 0
    # For each score in the scores list compare to the average.
    for score in scores_list:
        # If the score is below average increment the total.
        if score < average:
            total += 1
    return total      



# Input the scores.
scores = input("Enter scores: ")

# Convert the scores string to a list by using the split function.
scores_list_of_strings = scores.split()

# Convert the scores list from a list of strings
# to a list of numbers
# Start with an empty list
scores_list = []

# For each score string in the scores list
for score_string in scores_list_of_strings:
    # Append the score to the scores list
    # after using the eval function to convert
    # to the score string to a number.
    scores_list.append(eval(score_string))


# Find the average score.
average = findAverage(scores_list)

print("The average score is", average)
print(aboveAndEqualToAverageCount(scores_list, average), "are above ane equal to the average")
print(belowAverageCount(scores_list, average), "scores are below the average")
```
