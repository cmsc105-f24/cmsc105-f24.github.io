# Lab 2: Flowcharts, Programming, and Tracing

__Points Possible:__ 100

__Due:__ Thursday, September 12th 

In this lab, we will practice the concepts learned in week two. We will use flowcharts, tracing, and Python programming to solve the problems.

Submission:
1.	Please submit [flowcharts](../guides/flowchart) for each program design.
2.	Submit a Python file for each of the four programs.
3.	Submit [tracing tables](../guides/tracing) of each program (similar to how we practiced in class).


## Program 1: Compute the volume of a cylinder

Draw a [flowchart](../guides/flowchart) of the program design take a picture and save it as `flow1.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

Write a program that reads in the $radius$ and $length$ of a cylinder and computes the $area$ and $volume$ using the following formulas:

$$
area = radius * radius * \pi
$$

$$
volume = area * length
$$

* Where $\pi$ is 3.14159

Please print the $area$ and $volume$ values.

Save the program is `cylinder.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment. 

Complete a [tracing table](../guides/tracing) of the program above and take a picture and save it as `trace1.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

## Program 2: Miles to kilometers

Draw a [flowchart](../guides/flowchart) of the program design take a picture and save it as `flow2.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

Write a program that takes an input value in miles and converts and displays an equivalent value in kilometers (note that __1 mile is 1.609 kilometers__).

Save the program is `m2k.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

Complete a [tracing table](../guides/tracing) of the program above and take a picture and save it as `trace2.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

## Program 3: Financial application: calculate interest

Draw a [flowchart](../guides/flowchart) of the program design take a picture and save it as `flow3.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

If you know the $balance$ and the annual percentage interest rate, you can compute the $interest$ on the next monthly payment using the following formula:

$$
interest  =  balance * (AnnualInterestRate / 1200)
$$

Write a program that reads the $balance$ and the annual percentage interest rate and displays the $interest$ for the next month.

Save the program is `finance.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

Complete a [tracing table](../guides/tracing) of the program above and take a picture and save it as `trace3.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

# Program 4: Physics - find runway length

Draw a [flowchart](../guides/flowchart) of the program design take a picture and save it as `flow4.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration $a$ and take-off speed $v$, you can compute the minimum runway $length$ needed for an airplane to take off using the following formula:

$$
length = v^2 / 2a
$$


Write a program that prompts the user to enter velocity $v$ and acceleration $a$ and displays the minimum runway $length$.

Save the program is `physics.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

Complete a [tracing table](../guides/tracing) of the program above and take a picture and save it as `trace4.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

## Grading Rubric for each of the programs:

    </tr>
</table>

**TOTAL	25 points for each program**
