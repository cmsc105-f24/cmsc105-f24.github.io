# Lab 2: Flowcharts, Programming, and Tracing


## Program 1: Compute the volume of a cylinder


```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program calculates the area and volume of a cylinder 
based on the radius and length input by the user.
'''

# Set a variable that will hold the value of pi
PI = 3.14159

# Ask the user to enter a value for the radius
radius = eval(input("Enter a radius: "))  

# Ask the user to enter a value for the length
length = eval(input("Enter a length: "))  

# Calculate the area of the cylinder using the formula radius * radius * PI
area = radius * radius * PI

# Calculate the volume of the cylinder using the formula area * length
volume = area * length

# Print the results
print("The area of the cylinder is", area, "the volume is", volume)

```


## Program 2: Miles to kilometers

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program converts miles to kilometers.
'''

# Set a variable that will hold the value one mile in kilometers
ONE_MILE_IN_KILOMETERS = 1.609

# Ask the user to enter a value for the miles
miles = eval(input("Enter miles: "))  

# Convert to kilometers
kilometers = miles * ONE_MILE_IN_KILOMETERS

# Print the results
print(miles, "miles is", kilometers, "kilometers")

```


## Program 3: Financial application: calculate interest

Draw a [flowchart](../guides/flowchart) of the program design take a picture and save it as `flow3.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

If you know the $balance$ and the annual percentage interest rate, you can compute the $interest$ on the next monthly payment using the following formula:

$$
interest  =  balance * (AnnualInterestRate / 1200)
$$

Write a program that reads the $balance$ and the annual percentage interest rate and displays the $interest$ for the next month.

Save the program is `finance.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

Complete a [tracing table](../guides/tracing) of the program above and take a picture and save it as `trace3.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

## Program 4: Physics - find runway length

Draw a [flowchart](../guides/flowchart) of the program design take a picture and save it as `flow4.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration $a$ and take-off speed $v$, you can compute the minimum runway $length$ needed for an airplane to take off using the following formula:

$$
length = v^2 / 2a
$$


Write a program that prompts the user to enter velocity $v$ and acceleration $a$ and displays the minimum runway $length$.

Save the program is `physics.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

Complete a [tracing table](../guides/tracing) of the program above and take a picture and save it as `trace4.png` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

</table>

**TOTAL	25 points for each program**
