# Lab 10: Dictionaries


## Program 1: Count Vowels

**countvowels.py**

```python
''' 
Author name: <Your name here>
This program will count vowels in a string of vowels.
'''

def countVowels(vowel_string):
    # Create an empty dictionary
    dictionary = {}

    # Convert the string to lower case
    vowel_string = vowel_string.lower()

    # For each character in the vowel string
    for char in vowel_string:
        # If that character is in the dictionary
        if char in dictionary:
            # Increment the value by one
            dictionary[char] = dictionary[char] + 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, set the value to one
            dictionary[char] = 1

    # Return the dictionary
    return dictionary

# Input the string of vowels from the user
string_of_vowels = input("Enter a string of vowels: ")

# Call the count vowels function 
count_of_vowels = countVowels(string_of_vowels)

# Print out the resulting dictionary
print(count_of_vowels)
```


# Program 2: Unique Values

Given a dictionary of lists, write a program that extracts unique values in the
list and print a new list of unique values.

Given:

```
{'Student 1': [100, 98, 97, 96], 'Student 2': [88, 97, 75, 100], 'Student 3': [98,
97, 96, 77]}
```

Output: 

```
Unique items : [100, 98, 97, 96, 88, 75, 77]
```

__Hint:__  First, iterate over each key of the dictionary, next iterate over each element of the list associated with that key.

```python
for element in dict[key]:  # Here d[key] is a list.
```

Save the program is `uniquevalues.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

**Grading Rubric for the program:**
(Headers and comments: 5 points, input: 5 points, computation: 30 points, result: 5 points)
**Total: 45 points**


## Program 3: Grades

Write a program that takes as input a list of numbers and prints a dictionary
that contains key-value pairs for -- "Mean Value","Maximum Value" and
"Minimum Value".

Sample run:
```
lst=[10,12,32,4]
d={"Mean Value":14.5,"Maximum Value":32,"Minimum Value":4}
```

Save the program is `grades.py` and attach it to the Blackboard lab assignment.

**Grading Rubric for the program:**
(Headers and comments: 5 points, input: 5 points, computation: 15 points, result: 5 points)
**Total: 30 points**
